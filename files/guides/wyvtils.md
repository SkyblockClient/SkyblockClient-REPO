# Wyvtils Guide

## How do I use Wyvtils?
> to enable and disable features, type in either `/wyvtils` or `/wyvtil` in chat. 

## Some features require an API key (such as the GEXP and winstreak command).
> to add an API key, either type in `/api new` in chat, or type in `/wyvtils setkey [key]` if you already have one that you don't want to reset.

### To get help on commands, type this in chat:
> `/wyvtils help`
