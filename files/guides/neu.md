You can search for features using the textbox in the top left

At the bottom of your screen you will find a black box. You can search for skyblock items using this box.
If you double click the box, it will have a yellow border and will highlight any items in your inventory that have a matching name or lore as the textbox.
Double click the box again to turn this feature off.
