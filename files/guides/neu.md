# Not Enough Updates - How do I use it?

The main command is 
> /neu

From there on you will be greeted with a peculiar GUI at the middle of your screen:

![image of the GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nacrt/SkyblockClient-REPO/main/files/guides/images/NEUgui.png)

You can search for features using the scroll bar in the left part of this menu or using the search menu on the top right.

### Inventory

![Inventory GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nacrt/SkyblockClient-REPO/main/files/guides/images/NEUinventory.png)

At the bottom of your screen you will find a black box. You can search for Skyblock items using this box. (for example I searched "necron")   
If you double click the box, it will have a yellow border and will highlight any items in your inventory that have a matching name or lore as the textbox.
Double click the box again to turn this feature off.
