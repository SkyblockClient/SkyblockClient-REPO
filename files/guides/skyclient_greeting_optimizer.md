# SkyClient Greeting Optimizer

The SkyClient greeting asks if the user wants to apply "pre-optimized" settings. If the user agrees, SkyClient modifies various options to improve your FPS. This includes...

## Vanilla Video Settings

- Turns off Entity Shadows

The average Hypixel (and 1.8.9 in general) user does not really require entity shadows, and turning off entity shadows can help FPS quite a bit.

- Turns on VBOs

Essentially, this uses faster rendering methods, which obviously will improve your FPS.

- Turns off VSync

VSync caps your FPS to your current monitor's FPS. Although this can be useful in some cases, most of the time you don't need this.

- Uncaps FPS limit
- Sets Render Distance to 10

The maximum render distance in Hypixel is 10, and you usually don't need more than at 12 in almost all cases anyways.

## OptiFine Video Settings

- Turns off Fast Render

Although this could improve FPS a bit for computers with old GPUs, this sometimes causes visual glitches and is incompatible with HUDCaching.

- Turns off Fast Math

Fast math often causes more problems then it should, and thus it is turned off.

- Turn on Smart Animations

Smart Animations makes animations animate only when the texture itself is actually changing, improving FPS substantially.

- Turns on Render Regions

Render Regions essentially optimizes chunk loading and improves FPS in general.

- Turns off Smooth FPS

Despite the name, this actually decreases FPS substantially most of the time and is mostly dependant on the GPU.

- Turns off Smooth World
- Turns off Clouds
- Turns off Fog
- Sets Connected Textures to Fast
- Sets Translucent Blocks to Fast
- Sets Dropped Items to Fast
- Sets Vignette to Fast (off)
- Turns off Swamp Colors
- Sets Rain to Fast
- Turns off Shaders
