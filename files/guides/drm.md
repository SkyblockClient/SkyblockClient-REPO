# Dungeon Rooms Mod- How do I use it?

The Dungeon Rooms Mod is a mod developed by _risk that automatically detects what room of a dungeon you're in, and allows you to automatically open the room's secret guide in 
well-known Discord servers such as [**Dungeon Secret Guide**](https://discord.gg/dsg) and [**SkyBlockPersonalized**](https://discord.gg/QXA3y5EbNA).

### GUI
When you enter a room, at the top of your screen you will see a line of text saying "Dungeon Rooms: You are in _____". This tells you the room that you are in. If the room contains
a Fairy Soul, it  will be added to the line of text. 

### Commands
While in a dungeon, press the "O" key to launch the Discord channel of the dungeon room that you are in. 

Use /room set <DSG | SBP> to change what Discord server launches.

Use /room move <x> <y> to change where the text containing what room you are in is located. 

Use /room togglegui to disable the text appearing, but still enable the keybind to launch Discord.
