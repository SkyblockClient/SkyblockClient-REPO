# Dungeons Guide - How do I use it?

Dungeons Guide is a very advanced dungeon utility mod, featuring pathfinding to secrets and solvers for dungeon puzzles, along with other QOL features!

The command to open the config menu is:
> /dg 

The command to view a player's dungeons profile is:
> /dg pv <player>
> (This menu can be customized in /dg -> Dungeon Party -> View player stats when join -> Configure)

#### Secret Waypoint
- Enable the secret waypoint in /dg -> Pathfinding & Secrets 
- Once you join a dungeon, you can see a GUI on your screen, showing all the secrets in the room. You can choose the secret you want to navigate to, and there will be a pathfinding line leading you to the secret. 
- There's also an option to display a line to the next secret automatically (/dg -> Pathfinding & Secrets -> Display One)
