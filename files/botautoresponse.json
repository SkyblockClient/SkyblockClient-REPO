More FPS: Our coding cats were playing a prank on us, and cipher technology polymorphed your game into a turtle. We have reverted this change.\n\n3. Less Features & Slower Updates: Our patent for sticky replication technology was revoked, meaning we can no longer market features from freebies at a premium. You may need to download other mods to supplement for this loss.\n\n4. Worse Features: Studies show that features that do not exist underperform when compared to features that do exist.\n\nAnalytics show that BSMod is a success! It wouldn't be possible without you, the gullible Skyblock player. \ud83e\udd23\n\nPurchase logs show about 35,000 buyers at $5 each, netting us $175,000. \ud83e\udd11\nCosmetic purchases show about 10,000 colored characters at $4 each, netting us about $40,000. \ud83e\udd11\n\nRegrettably, our counter for the number of times your colored character reset broke... We are unable to provide a quantifiable measure of profits, but just know we took your money! \ud83d\ude05\n\nBSMod was a very profitable endeavor and our team at BetaDawn LLC is proud to have made so much money off BSMod.

You can change this to only when song is playing via the config.\n\nQ: Craftify shows 'Media Not Found'!\nA: Currently Craftify only supports albums, so you are likely listening to a Spotify podcast or video.\n(Note: You can hide this message by changing \"display mode\" to \"when song is found\".)\n\nQ: Controls aren't working!\nA: Controls only work for Spotify Premium members, as Spotify has locked the music control API behind folks with Spotify Premium.\n\nQ: Can Craftify send a message when a song changes?\nA: Yes, in the config you can find the \"Announce New Song\" setting which has 3 different modes to choose from.\n\nQ: Can I change where Craftify shows up to?\nA: Yes, there are select modes in the config for where the UI should show. If you have another one that you think could be useful, you can suggest it in the mod's discord (`-discord boat`), but the current ones are the most popular ones requested."

This might mean choosing a different folder from usual (which exists on Mart), copying SkyClient over, or linking the folders together. A guide on installing Prism and copying over your SkyClient installation is at <https://microcontrollersdev.github.io/Alternatives/launcher/prism_win>.\nAlternative methods (not recommended):\n- Windows: Open cmd and run `mklink /J \"MULTIMC PATH/INSTANCE NAME/minecraft\" \"%APPDATA%/.minecraft/skyclient\"`\n- Mac: Open Terminal and run `ln -s \"MULTIMC PATH/INSTANCE NAME/.minecraft\" \"~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/skyclient\"`\n- Linux: Open your terminal and run `ln -s \"~/.minecraft/skyclient\" \"MULTIMC PATH/INSTANCE NAME/.minecraft\"`"

        "response": "Q: How much RAM should I allocate to Minecraft?\nA:\n- 3-4GB if you have 8GB+ available\n- 3GB if you have 5-6GB available\n- 2GB (default) if you have less than 4GB available\n\nQ: Isn't having more RAM better?\nA: No. Unless you are playing a heavily modded 1.16 modpack, your game is almost never going to need more than 4GB. By allocating more than 4GB, Java will end up wasting memory and this usually results in worse performance. Also, by allocating more RAM to Java, you're preventing other apps on your computer from taking advantage of the RAM.\n\nQ: B.. but I have 32GB of RAM on my computer, so I'm going to allocate 30GB of RAM to Minecraft and you can't stop me\n\nA: Please please please don't do that, you cl\ud83e\udd21wn.\n\nConclusion: There's no advantage to having more than 4GB, so you should allocate 4GB (or less) just in case."
