Over almost two years ago, Skye, one of the former Moulberry Staff members, and I started working on a program that installs Forge, Optifine and every other mod and pack that you might need to play Skyblock (or just the game in general).

This is the result of that project. Designed to be a great alternative to clients like Badlion and Lunar,
and have a lot of convenience for the end user.

[COLOR=rgb(0, 0, 0)][SIZE=4]This one basically explains itself.
Just choose your mods and packs, and click "Install SkyClient" to install.
You also won't need to install Java, as Minecraft comes with its own version by default.[/SIZE][/COLOR]

[COLOR=rgb(112, 203, 68)][SIZE=5][U][B]Update your mods with very minimal effort[/B][/U][/SIZE][/COLOR]
We know how annoying it is to check your mods for updates.
Simply install SkyClient Updater and it will install all mods that are outdated for you as soon as you start up.
[B][SIZE=3]DISCLAIMER: THE UPDATE FUNCTION ON THE INSTALLER IS DEPRECATED AND DOES NOT WORK.[/SIZE][/B]

[COLOR=rgb(112, 203, 68)][SIZE=5][U][B]Add your own mods and packs[/B][/U][/SIZE][/COLOR]
Many people like to use things like SBE (no matter how wrong they are), and while we obviously didn't get to include it, you can still add it to your installation:
Simply put everything in [B].minecraft/skyclient [/B]instead of [B].minecraft[/B] (or whatever custom installation you put it in),and they will work just like they did before.
You can also access the mods folder quickly by clicking a button in the "Advanced Settings" menu.
[B][SIZE=3]Note: You need to have SkyClient installed before you do this.[/SIZE][/B]

[COLOR=rgb(112, 203, 68)][U][SIZE=5][B]Understand what your mods do and where they come from[/B][/SIZE][/U][/COLOR]
Many people simply do not know what the mods they have installed actually do, and download them just because a YouTuber recommended them.
That's why we've added a little guide for every single mod we include in our installer to understand if you want the features in the mod or not.
Along with that, you can easily access the Github page, website, video, or whatever source the mod is from, by simply pressing the buttons next to it.

[SIZE=6][COLOR=rgb(112, 203, 68)][U][B]Ooops! Windows Defender Alert![/B][/U][/COLOR][/SIZE]
The only reason Windows Defender says "We protected your PC" is because we did not buy an expensive certificate for it. (And why do we need to? We are devs working on this in our free time.)
It simply means it isn't a Microsoft certified program (like all other software).
This isn't an issue for Java devs or mod makers because Windows doesn't run the Jar file. Java does.
